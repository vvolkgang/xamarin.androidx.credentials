# Xamarin Android binding for AndroidX.Credentials

androidx.credentials [maven link](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.credentials/credentials).

Google released `1.0.x` in Jan 2023 and then in Feb 2023 released `1.2.x` which seems to target Android >=14. As of May 20th 2023 they're still releasing updates to both libs at the same time.

For this binding, `1.0.x` was used.

## Known Issues

1. Build Warnings 
    * Unknown parameters /  duplicate nested type name due to `.Companion` objects
1. Lack of C# Async friendly APIs
